## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

With this project, I had the opportunity to practise using React library and test my knowledge of CSS grid.
I structured it into two main sections: "header" and "main", and in particular, I built the main section using the grid-template-areas CSS property.
By using this property, I easily positioned the different elements of the "main" section as required.
